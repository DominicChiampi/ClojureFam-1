# Versions of ClojureFam

Currently we have two main versions of the program:  
1. Teams (Mentorless) 
2. Partners (Mentorship and Mentorless) 

That said, you will get in *much* faster if you decide to go the mentorless route.

# Curriculum

The first cohorts of this program will follow the resources and material in [Onboarding for New Clojurians](https://www.notion.so/Onboarding-for-New-Clojurians-b34b38f30902448cae68afffa02425c1). 

- The goals are:  
    - Completing 100 problems on 4clojure.  
    - Working through Clojure from the Ground Up, completing exercises.  
    - Working through Brave Clojure, completing exercises.  
- These goals should be adjusted for more advanced Learners.  
- The program will culminate in the Learners working together to merge a Pull Request addressing an Athens issue. See [Expectations](#expectations) in the case that there are no good issues to work on.
- Each Learner will define their own checkpoints by submitting an issue to track their progress on the [ClojureFam Progress Board](https://github.com/athensresearch/ClojureFam/projects/2)
- Learners are encouraged to blog or Tweet about their experience learning Clojure, so as to get more people interested in the joy of Clojure programming.
- Learners are encouraged to create and refine Clojure learning material. Such material could be:
  - Outlines of material learned ([example](https://github.com/aphyr/distsys-class)). This content would evolve, each generation adding and refining their own learnings. 
  - Clojure or Datascript Koans for future learners. 
  - Video content showing examples of partner or team learning exercises.
  - Learning maps and guides.

# Expectations for Learners

> "Ask not what the Clojure community can do for you — ask what you can do for the Clojure community." 

- Spend at least 5 weeks in the program with your Learner partner or team.
- Be proactive in communications.
- Learners are expected to have at least one synchronous video call / pair programming session per week with their partner, a member of their team, and/or their mentor.
- Be prepared to make revisions to code before a successful commit. The bar for quality of contributions may be high.
- There may be changes in the Athens tech stack. Please remember that this is a new project in a new organization.
- The number of issues that you will be able to work on may vary. In fact, at times there may be more demand for issues than available issues to work on. In this case, be prepared to find other ways to contribute to Athens or other open source Clojure projects.
- When choosing an issue:
    1. Communicate about the issue 
    2. Create a branch and a WIP pull request
    3. Ask for feedback



# Why contribute as a mentor?

The Clojure community is friendly and welcoming like no other. Ask a question on Clojureverse, and you're bound to get a decent reply. Find the right channel on Slack, and you might just get bespoke support from the library author him or herself.

So why take part in the ClojureFam program?

Questions come and go. Libraries and side-projects get abandoned. The flux of people can make us lose track of the individuals.

As a ClojureFam mentor, you have the chance to connect personally to motivated programmers, who are learning Clojure primarily to contribute to Athens.

Athens Research is building "networked thought" tools with Clojurescript and Datascript. The people using these new "networked thought" platforms and technologies are not random people. They are hungry learners and autodidacts who want to create and share knowledge. Many have non-trivial programming experience and work at top-tier startups and corporations. They simply haven't used Clojure before. This is all to say that ClojureFam could be a great recruiting pipeline for your company :)

## Expectations for Mentors

- Spend at least 5 weeks with their Learner team.
- Have at least one synchronous communication session per week with their Learner team.
- Make sure the team has a focused set of goals. A Learner that "just wants to contribute to Athens" may need help in finding more specific ways to contribute.
- Questions are almost always better than directions. Socrates showed us the way.
