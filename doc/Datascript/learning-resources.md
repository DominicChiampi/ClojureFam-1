## Datascript Learning Resources

> "If I have seen further it is by standing on the shoulders of Giants."

– Sir Isaac Newton

### Purpose
To compile and curate existing Datascript learning resources. Ideally, we will iterate on these resources and integrate our learnings–as builders–into our learning platform. For example, we could integrate the learning objectives in Resource no.1 into the Datascript explorer so that the Learners need to go to one source, not two.
