# ADR 2: Require 2/3 votes for non-critical decisions and actions

## Context

Moving ClojureFam forward, we'll need to make decisions and stay in sync. Clear
guidelines for making decisions lets us move faster. If a decision turns out to
be a wrong call, roll it back.

Jeff, Jeroen, and nthd3gr33 did that at the beginning and it allowed them to
move really fast.

## Decision

For all non-critical decisions and actions, 2/3 vote means approval

## Status

## Consequences

We have a decision protocol to follow.
