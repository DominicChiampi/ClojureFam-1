# ADR 1: Use ClojureFam Github repostory for all relevant information

## Context

Athens uses Notion for organizational knowledge management. The _Onboarding for
new Clojurians_ document is on Notion. The _Vision_, the _Governance_ document,
the _Code of Conduct_, all on Notion.

For ClojureFam, we need to share code for learning. That means we need a source
code repository.

Then, what information belongs in Notion, and what belongs in the Github
repository?

## Decision

Use ClojureFam Github repostory for all relevant information. ClojureFam
participants should not have to exit the repository to find the information they
need.

## Consequences

- When developing learning resources, we seek to use this repository over other
  resources.
- Reach "knowledge parity" with the _Onboarding for new Clojurians_  document: the ClojureFam repo should be self-sufficient
