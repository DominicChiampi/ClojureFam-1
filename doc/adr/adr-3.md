# ADR 3: Expose learning system from the REPL

## Context

How should users interact with learning resources? Using books, information is
read, understood and reproduced. We already have a "sandbox repository" to fire
up a REPL in and start learning in.

## Decision

We will concentrate our efforts around learning material that can be used from
_within_ the REPL.

## Consequences

- We will spend less effort writing textual guides in the beginning.
